Hello, I'm Matthieu and happy to get to know each other ! :)

Since I was 18 years old, I have been passionate about computers and especially computer development. 
It hasn't been too long, but it also means that I still have so much to learn! Because even if I love computers, I love learning. 

I bring expertise in web and mobile development, taking into account the latest technologies. 
I am known for my passion, my sympathy, my commitment and my enthusiasm to always find a relevant solution to the personal problems of my clients, in order to help them come out on top of all the challenges they have to overcome.

I accompany projects to make them grow in the web and mobile world. 
I develop applications/sites in order to achieve this goal. I also train students in order to accompany them in the world of computer development and bring them to become developers themselves.
